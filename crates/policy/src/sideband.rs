//! Sideband approval flow (§2.11, §2.14).
//!
//! When the agent needs controller approval — a Rule-of-Two trigger,
//! a cold-contact admittance request, a sensitive tool invocation —
//! the control plane issues a **signed approval request** carrying a
//! one-time token, dispatches it over a *different* transport than
//! the one that triggered it, and parks the conversation until the
//! controller's signed response arrives.
//!
//! Key properties:
//!
//! - The approval token is Ed25519-signed by the server (same key the
//!   capability tokens use), so transports can't forge approvals.
//! - The token is single-use: the server records the token's `jti` in
//!   `state_inbox` on first consumption; replays are rejected.
//! - The notification goes over a **different transport** from the one
//!   that introduced the untrusted content — so an attacker controlling
//!   Signal can't approve their own request via Signal.
