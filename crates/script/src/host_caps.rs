//! [`HostCapabilities`] — the surface a Rhai plugin reaches when
//! it needs the host to do something the script tier can't (yet)
//! do for itself.
//!
//! Why this trait exists: the script tier's `primitives.rs`
//! already exposes pure-data helpers (HTTP, JSON, base64 coming
//! soon, time, hashing). Channel plugins like Signal need more —
//! a long-lived WebSocket consumer, a way to push decoded
//! inbound messages through the host's standard routing pipeline
//! (trust admit → conversation resolve → group classifier →
//! dispatch), and a way to look up where a supervised sidecar is
//! actually listening. None of those make sense as plain Rhai
//! primitives because they need access to host-owned state
//! (sidecar supervisor, AppState, the routing pipeline).
//!
//! `HostCapabilities` is the narrow surface those bindings flow
//! through. The `execlaw-server` crate provides the concrete
//! `Arc<dyn HostCapabilities>` at boot; the script engine forwards
//! it into the per-plugin engine; primitives.rs registers
//! Rhai-callable closures that delegate to the trait methods.
//!
//! Keep this trait small. Every method is a coupling point
//! between the script tier and the host — easy to add, hard to
//! remove without breaking installed plugins.
