//! [`ScriptEngine`] — factory for per-plugin Rhai engines.
//!
//! Each [`crate::ScriptPlugin`] gets its own [`rhai::Engine`] so
//! the registered primitives (HTTP, cache, logging) can capture
//! per-plugin state (the plugin_id, the per-plugin cache, the
//! shared HTTP client) without the engines stepping on each other.
//! That isolation costs ~300 KB of stdlib per plugin — fine at
//! single-digit plugin counts.
