//! Owns the `state_bus_events` table — DISTINCT from `state_events`
//! (the per-conversation event log). The two tables share no foreign
//! keys, no rows, and no invariants. They are independent substrates:
//!
//!   * `state_events` is conversation-scoped, append-only, HMAC-
//!     chained, and replayed to reconstruct turn state.
//!   * `state_bus_events` is the durable inbox for external signals
//!     (webhooks, socket transports, plugin emits, routine fires)
//!     that automations subscribe to.
//!
//! This module contains pure data + DB code:
//!
//!   * `Event` envelope shape
//!   * `BusEventKind` (separate enum from `crate::events::EventKind`)
//!   * `BusEventStore` (insert + read + retention primitives)
//!
//! The dispatcher (mpsc consumer + worker pool) and the internal
//! poller live in `crates/server/src/automation_bus.rs` because they
//! need tokio + `AppState`. Keeping persistence here mirrors how
//! `routines.rs` (core) and `routine_runner.rs` (server) are split.
