//! Tool-implementation trait + capability-scoped runtime context.
//!
//! This is the contract every executable tool — built-in, plugin, MCP —
//! eventually satisfies. The runtime hands a tool an `invoke(ctx, args)`
//! call where `ctx` exposes ONLY the capability APIs the tool's
//! descriptor declared. There is intentionally **no `db: Database`
//! handle** in `ToolCtx`: a tool that wants to read messages calls
//! `ctx.conversation.read_events(...)` and gets a trust-filtered view;
//! a tool that wants to read memory calls `ctx.memory.read(...)` and
//! gets a trust-class-scoped lookup. The implementations of those API
//! traits hold the underlying `Database` privately.
//!
//! ## Why no raw DB handle
//!
//! Passing a `Database` to a tool would let any tool — built-in or
//! plugin — read every table: users, refresh tokens, vault blobs,
//! every conversation's events. That's ambient authority and a textbook
//! prompt-injection blast-radius problem. The capability-scoped APIs
//! are the security boundary: a tool can only do what its declared
//! capability set allows, the implementation enforces caller-trust and
//! caller-conversation scoping internally, and a buggy tool's worst
//! case is bounded by what its capabilities expose.
//!
//! ## Where this fits
//!
//! - `ToolImpl` — the trait every tool implements. Stateless; one
//!   `Arc<dyn ToolImpl>` per tool, registered into the host's
//!   `HookRegistry`. The dispatch layer constructs a `ToolCtx` per call.
//! - `ToolDescriptor` — the metadata the registry stores: name, schema,
//!   capability set, default allowed trust classes. The LLM sees the
//!   `name` + `description` + `schema`.
//! - `Capability` — the enum a descriptor lists. Each variant maps 1:1
//!   to an `Option<Arc<dyn FooApi>>` field on `ToolCtx`. The runtime
//!   populates a field if and only if the descriptor declared that
//!   capability — so a tool that didn't declare `WebFetch` finds
//!   `ctx.web_fetch == None` and can't even construct a call.
//! - Capability API traits (`ConversationApi`, `MemoryApi`, …) — narrow
//!   façades over the underlying stores. Methods take only what's
//!   intrinsic to the operation (e.g. `read_events(before, limit)`)
//!   because caller-trust and caller-conversation are baked into the
//!   trait-object impl at construction time.
//!
