//! Supervisor — picks up `Pending` rows and spawns runners.
//!
//! One tokio task that wakes every `TICK_INTERVAL` (5s by default,
//! short enough that operator-initiated jobs feel snappy without
//! hammering the DB). Per tick:
//!
//!   1. Atomically claim the next `Pending` row (mints a card_id
//!      and flips status to `Planning` in one transaction so two
//!      supervisors can't grab the same job).
//!   2. Resolve an inference client via [`crate::inference_resolver
//!      ::InferenceResolver`].
//!   3. Spawn a per-job tokio task driving `runner::run_job`.
//!
//! Failures inside the runner are isolated — the supervisor keeps
//! ticking. The runner is responsible for marking the row `Failed`
//! and emitting `CardClosed{Failed}` on its own.
