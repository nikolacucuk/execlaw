///   3. **Tool routing prose** (delta #2 from the agent-prompting
///      audit, 2026-05). Built dynamically from the live tool
///      catalogue so the model gets a "Quick reference: which tool
///      family handles which kind of task" map BEFORE it scans the
///      individual descriptions. Mirrors what selfhosted-claw's
///      `buildSystemPrompt` baked in statically; here the prefixes
///      we recognise drive emission so newly-installed plugins
///      light up automatically without a code change.
///
/// Operators override "agent voice"; the static base owns
/// non-negotiable safety rules; the routing block teaches the
/// model when to reach for which family.
/// Turn `(tool_name, args)` into a one-liner the operator can
/// read while the agent works. Mirrors the "Searching for X…" UX
/// selfhosted-claw used to surface in its activity pill, but
/// generated server-side so the SPA stays a dumb subscriber.
///
/// The mapping is a hand-tuned table for the families execlaw
/// ships today; tools without a match get a generic fallback so a
/// freshly-installed plugin's tool still surfaces something
/// readable instead of a raw symbol name.
///

    // 2026-05-16 — prompt-budget regression tests.
    //
    // Background: the Signal-channel chart-rendering 400s
    // ("Expecting ',' delimiter at column N") that prompted the
    // round-N+1 canonicalization fix correlated directly with the
    // *length* of the per-turn system prompt. The same prompt
    // rendered fine on the web channel because web's turn_context
    // is shorter; Signal-tier additions (origin-channel nudge,
    // group block, trust class line, sender principal id) tipped
    // a quantized 27B model just enough off-distribution to start
    // emitting malformed JSON in tool_call.arguments.
    //
    // These tests pin a character-count ceiling per channel so a
    // future edit to `build_turn_context_prose` can't quietly
    // re-introduce the drift. The ceilings are set with ~20-25%
    // headroom over the measured 2026-05-16 sizes — enough room
    // for one normal edit, tight enough to alarm before a "let me
    // just add one more clarifying paragraph" doubles the budget.
    //
    // When this test fails, the right responses (in order):
    //   1. Trim the new prose — most additions can be tightened.
    //   2. Move the new prose into the static `system_prompt`
    //      base (in `config_system_prompt`) so it doesn't grow
    //      the *per-turn* surface specifically.
    //   3. Only if neither works: raise the ceiling intentionally,
    //      with a comment explaining why, and verify the Signal
    //      chart-render flow still passes end-to-end.
    //
    // Reference values (2026-05-16 measurement):
    //   * web:           667 chars
    //   * signal DM:     596 chars
    //   * signal group:  1180 chars
    //
    // The web vs signal-DM comparison is misleading — web is
    // longer because it includes timezone framing (which signal
    // doesn't get). Signal-DM + signal-group is the curve that
    // matters; group adds the hard-rules block.
