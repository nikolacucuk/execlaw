//!   * **Inbound persistence** — decoding `data:` URLs from the SPA
//!     composer ([`persist_inline_attachments`]) and fetching bytes
//!     out of a transport bridge ([`persist_inbound_attachments`]),
//!     both routing through [`write_attachment_blob`]. The blob
//!     store is content-addressed under `<data_dir>/blobs/`; rows
//!     live in `state_attachments` scoped to the conversation.
//!
//!   * **Outbound shaping** — [`encode_attachments_as_data_urls`]
//!     reverses the persistence for the per-turn vision content
//!     array, plus the small [`extract_*`] / [`hydrate_*`] helpers
//!     that `list_messages` uses to project the on-disk event log
//!     into the SPA's `MessageView` shape.
//!
//! No new types are introduced; all returns either flow into

// =====================================================================
// Data refs (2026-05-16)
// =====================================================================
//
// A "data ref" is the host's mechanism for letting one tool's output
// flow into another tool's input WITHOUT the model having to re-emit
// the bytes. The chart-from-stock-history use case made the cost
// concrete: the model emitting 125 NKE OHLC rows back into a
// `chart.render` call took 120+ seconds of decode and timed out the
// HTTP read at vLLM. The right answer is to never make the model
// retype data it just received — store the value server-side under a
// fresh id, give the model the id, and let it pass that id to the
// next tool.
//
// Storage: piggybacks on `state_artifacts` with mime
// `application/json` and `kind = "plugin_artifact"`. Inherits the
// table's TTL + content-addressing for free.
//
// Resolution: see `tool_dispatch::resolve_data_refs` for the wire
// shape (`{"$data_ref": "<id>"}`) and the recursive substitution
// pass that runs before every tool invocation.

// The constants + `persist_data_ref` are the producer half of the
// data-ref scaffolding; only the consumer half (`fetch_data_ref` +
// the `{"$data_ref": "<id>"}` substitution pass in `tool_dispatch`)
// is wired into the agent loop today. Plugins that want to mint a
// data ref still go through their own AttachmentStore call directly.
// Kept around so the producer side is ready when a tool surfaces
// that needs it — flag as allowed-dead-code rather than deleting so
// the doc + invariants stay where future callers will look for them.

/// Default TTL for data refs — long enough that a multi-round turn
/// (tool A produces a ref → model reasons → tool B consumes it) has
/// breathing room, short enough that abandoned refs don't pile up
/// indefinitely on disk. The ephemeral sweeper culls expired rows
