//! Sidecar supervisor (Phase 2b — `docs/sidecar-supervisor-design.md`).
//!
//! Owns the lifecycle of every transport-sidecar sidecar container
//! declared by an installed plugin's `[[services]]` entries with a
//! `[services.sidecar]` table. Conceptually the third member of the
//! supervisor family alongside `backend_supervisor` (inference
//! containers) and `runner_supervisor` (per-group runner containers):
//!
//!   * **`backend_supervisor`** — owns vLLM / TTS / STT containers.
//!   * **`runner_supervisor`** — owns per-principal-group runner
//!     containers (the agent loop).
//!   * **`sidecar_supervisor`** *(this)* — owns Signal-cli /
//!     WhatsApp-sidecar / Matrix-sidecar / ... sidecars. One container
//!     per registered sidecar (`HookRegistry::all_sidecars` is the
//!     source of truth for desired state.
//!
//! What's in scope **for Phase 2b**:
//!   * tick + reconcile pattern mirroring `backend_supervisor`
//!   * spawn-on-register, healthcheck-loop, restart-on-crash with
//!     exponential-attempt cap, stop-on-unregister
//!   * status snapshot for the SPA's sidecars page (a future hookup)
//!
//! What's deliberately **not** in scope yet (Phase 3 work):
//!   * the sidecar RPC client (`/v1/send`, `/v1/inbound/stream`)
//!   * inbound message ingestion → `state_transport_bindings` lookup
//!   * outbound dispatch wired into `signal.send_message`
//!   * fingerprinted alert routing on sidecar-down events
//!
//! Tests use `MockServiceController` so no Docker daemon is touched
//! and every transition can be driven deterministically.
