//! Shared "admit a sender into the trust ladder" helper for every
//! external transport (web chat, Signal, future bridges).
//!
//! The function lives here rather than in core because it composes
//! three layers that core can't depend on:
//!
//!   * [`PrincipalStore`] (core) — the persisted principal table
//!     and `find_by_identifier` index.
//!   * [`PluginHost::resolve_identity`] (plugin-host) — fanout to
//!     installed identity-provider plugins.
//!   * [`TrustPolicy`] (core) — the operator-editable knobs that
//!     control whether plugin matches admit and at what class.
//!
//! Before this helper landed, `chats.rs` did a hardcoded
//! "elevate to KnownTrusted on any plugin match" path inline, and
//! `signal_inbound.rs` did nothing — a sender known via Google
//! Contacts who messaged the agent on Signal was treated as a
//! cold contact even though the same handle on web auto-trusted.
//! Now both routes admit through the same function and the operator's
//! Trust Policy is load-bearing.
//!
//! The flow:
//!
//!   1. Look up the principal by id (`raw`). Hit → return as-is.
//!   2. Look up by identifier (`{transport, handle}`) — catches the
//!      operator's "My identities" mappings, where the controller
//!      has asserted that `signal:+15551234567` is them. Hit →
//!      return that principal (typically the Controller).
//!   3. Read `TrustPolicy`. If `auto_trust_contacts == false`, skip
//!      to step 5.
//!   4. Call every registered identity-provider plugin via
//!      `PluginHost::resolve_identity`. Translate the transport
//!      to the resolver-kind plugins declare in their `[identity_provider]
//!      .resolves` (e.g. Signal's `+`-prefixed handles map to
//!      `phone`). Pick the highest-confidence match whose
//!      `trust_hint` >= `min_trust_hint_for_auto_trust`. Hit → mint
//!      a new principal at `auto_trust_class` (default: `KnownLimited`).
//!   5. Mint as `UnknownPending`. Caller routes to the cold-contact
//!      gate.
