//! Per-principal-group runner supervisor.
//!
//! The supervisor owns:
//!   * the in-memory **registry** mapping `group_id → RunnerHandle`
//!     (the live WS connection, in-flight turn count, last-active
//!     timestamp, controller-pin flag),
//!   * **spawn / stop** lifecycle via `bollard`,
//!   * **registration auth** (one-time spawn secrets minted per
//!     `ensure(group_id)`, consumed when the runner phones home),
//!   * **forwarding** turn requests from `chats.rs` over each
//!     runner's WS and surfacing per-frame events back to the
//!     caller as a stream,
//!   * **reaping** idle runners (10 min for non-controller groups;
//!     never for controller groups) plus a per-turn max-duration
//!     watchdog that recovers wedged runners,
//!   * **workspace volume** lifecycle — created on first spawn,
//!     wiped only on idle reap / explicit "wipe workspace" /
//!     group delete.
//!
//! The supervisor does NOT own:
//!   * the event log (runners propose `EventLogAppend` frames; the
//!     supervisor signs + commits via `EventLog::append`),
//!   * the inference-backend lifecycle (`backend_supervisor` already
//!     owns that),
//!   * the SPA's WebSocket bus (`events::EventBus`) — the supervisor
//!     translates incoming `RunnerToServer` frames into `UiEvent`s
//!     and republishes on the existing bus.
//!
//! This module is the v1 skeleton: registry + auth + forwarding +
//! reaper. The bollard-driven spawn + workspace volume management
//! live in `runner_spawn.rs` (sibling). Tests in this file exercise
//! the registry + reaper logic with no Docker and no real WS — they
//! use the `RunnerHandle::test_handle()` constructor and a tokio
//! mpsc pair that stands in for the socket.
