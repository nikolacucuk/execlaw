//! Channel-agnostic group inbound routing decisions.
//!
//! Every transport that delivers messages into multi-participant
//! conversations (Signal groups today; future WhatsApp groups,
//! email threads, SMS group MMS, Discord channels...) faces the
//! same question: *should the agent answer this message?* Bots in
//! groups that always answer are universally annoying — operators
//! consistently report "the bot keeps replying to messages clearly
//! aimed at someone else."
//!
//! This module is the answer: a single entry point
//! [`should_dispatch_to_agent`] that any transport's group-routing
//! path calls before invoking [`crate::chats::dispatch_external_turn`].
//! It encapsulates four layers of decision, in order of cost:
//!
//! 1. **Transport-supplied verdict** — when the plugin set
//!    `mention_of_self = Some(true)` on the inbound (Slack today;
//!    any future transport with a structured `<@bot>` mention),
//!    we trust it and skip every downstream check. Saves the
//!    classifier round-trip on the messages most likely to be
//!    addressed.
//!
//! 2. **Eligibility gate** — does this conversation actually need
//!    classification? A 1:1 conversation (controller ↔ agent only)
//!    or any conversation where the only participant is the
//!    Controller falls through to "always dispatch." We only spend
//!    inference budget on classification when there's at least one
//!    other human in the room.
//!
//! 3. **Cheap name-mention shortcut** — if the agent's configured
//!    `display_name` appears in the message text (case-insensitive
//!    substring), skip the LLM. Catches the obvious "Lena, can you
//!    ..." case for ~free.
//!
//! 4. **LLM classifier** — for conversations that pass every cheap
//!    gate, consult a small/fast inference backend to decide if the
//!    inbound text is directed at the agent. The classifier knows
//!    the agent's configured display name + role from the
//!    personality store and returns a strict
//!    `{"directed": bool}` JSON verdict.
//!
//! ### Fall-open semantics
//!
//! Every uncertain path returns dispatch=true (= run the turn,
//! preserve "agent answers" behaviour). The ONLY return-skip path
//! is a clean `{"directed": false}` verdict on a group-with-
//! external-users conversation. A misbehaving classifier degrades
//! to "agent answers everything" rather than "agent silent on
//! everything" — the safer of the two failure modes.
//!
//! ### Verdict surfacing
//!
//! The return shape is rich enough that the caller can thread the
//! reason into the agent's per-turn system prompt (see
//! [`crate::chats::GroupTurnContext`]). Telling the model *why* it
//! was woken up — "you were named in the text," "the classifier
//! decided this was directed at you," "the classifier was
//! unavailable" — gives it the context it needs to be more
//! reserved when the upstream signal is weaker.
