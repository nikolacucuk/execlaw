//! Inference-backend service container lifecycle (Phase 12.B).
//!
//! `ServiceController` is the operator-facing primitive the
//! `BackendSupervisor` (server crate, Phase 12.C) drives to spawn,
//! stop, and health-check inference service containers (vLLM,
//! Whisper, Kokoro, etc.). The trait abstracts the underlying
//! container runtime so:
//!
//!   * Production wires `BollardServiceController` (real Docker).
//!   * Tests wire `MockServiceController` (deterministic in-memory
//!     state machine), which is the only way the supervisor's
//!     reconciliation logic gets meaningfully tested without a
//!     live Docker daemon.
//!
//! v1 scope: pull image, create + start + stop + inspect, plus an
//! HTTP health probe. GPU passthrough handles the locked-decision
//! NVIDIA case via `DeviceRequest`; Intel Arc / AMD passthrough lands
//! when those plugins do.
