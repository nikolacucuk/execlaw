//! Hook registry (§4.2).
//!
//! When a plugin is enabled, its manifest hook declarations register
//! into live lookup maps keyed by the appropriate primary key:
//!
//! - `tools_by_name` — every declared `[[tools]]` entry, keyed by tool name
//! - `ui_panels_by_mount` — `[[ui_panels]]` keyed by mount path
//! - `transports_by_id` — the plugin's `[transport]` keyed by transport id
//! - `identity_providers` — all enabled `[identity_provider]` plugins
//! - `event_subscriptions_by_kind` — which plugins listen for which events
//! - `alert_sources_by_prefix` — which plugins own alert fingerprint prefixes
//!
//! The registry is **additive per plugin, atomic per enable**: enabling
//! registers every hook the manifest declares; disabling removes them
//! all at once.
