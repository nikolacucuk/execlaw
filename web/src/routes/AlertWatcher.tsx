// Persistent alert-event WebSocket subscription.
//
// Why a dedicated top-level component:
//   * The Sidebar renders the alert badge on every authenticated
//     route (Chat, Settings, Research, Routines, Skills, Approvals).
//   * Pre-fix the only WsClient in the SPA lived inside Chat.tsx —
//     so navigating off /chat tore the WS down, leaving the badge
//     reliant on the 60s poll. New alerts that fired while the
//     operator was on Settings only surfaced after a manual refresh
//     (the symptom the operator hit on the OAuth-scope alert).
//   * Each per-route Sidebar is remounted on navigation; putting
//     the WS inside the Sidebar would flap the connection on every
//     click.
//
// This component is headless (returns null), mounted ONCE at the
// App level inside AuthProvider, and:
//   1. Opens a WsClient when auth is authenticated.
//   2. Listens for `alert_fired` and `alert_resolved` frames.
//   3. Re-queries the canonical firing count via getAlertCount()
//      and writes it to the chat store. (The local count math is
//      avoided on purpose — server-side dedup means a "fired"
//      event might be a no-op for an existing fingerprint.)
//   4. Closes the WS when auth flips back to unauthenticated.
//
// Chat.tsx still owns its own WsClient for chat-specific events
// (chat_message_*, conversation_phase_changed, etc.) — overlap is
// acceptable; the server's broadcast channel handles many
// subscribers cheaply.
