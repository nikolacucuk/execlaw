# execlaw — Operator setup walkthroughs

Per-transport / per-integration pairing flows. The
[`docs/plugins.md`](plugins.md) doc is plugin-author-facing; this is
operator-facing — what a person actually clicks through after
`execlaw install` to get inbound messages flowing.

Common assumptions for every section below:

- The control plane is running (`execlaw service status` →
  `running`) and reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:3031`.
- You're signed in as the controller in the SPA.
- The plugin you're configuring is **installed and enabled**
  (Settings → Plugins → upload ZIP → enable). All routing,
  registry registration, and sidecar supervision happens on
  enable; the per-plugin admin UI assumes that's already done.

## Signal (signal-cli sidecar)

Signal's transport plugin runs the bbernhard signal-cli REST API as a
supervised sidecar. Pairing is QR-based — execlaw shows a QR image,
you scan it from the official Signal mobile app under "Linked
devices."

### Steps

1. **Install + enable** `plugins/signal/`. The sidecar
   (`bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest`) starts in JSON-RPC mode
   on host port `:8501` and persists state under
   `~/.execlaw/sidecars/signal/signal-cli/data/` so the linked-device
   pairing survives restarts.

2. Open **Settings → Plugins → Signal**. The page polls
   `/api/admin/plugins/signal/status` every few seconds.

3. Wait for the status block to show `Sidecar healthy` (green).
   Initial sidecar spawn includes a Docker image pull — first run
   takes 10–30 s.

4. Click **Pair a device**. A QR code data-URL is fetched from
   `/api/admin/plugins/signal/qrcodelink` and rendered.

5. On your phone: Signal app → **Settings → Linked devices →
   Add new device** (the `+` icon), then scan the QR.

6. The page refreshes when the pairing completes. Status flips to
   `Paired as <your phone number>` and the agent will start receiving
   inbound messages.

### Common pitfalls

- **QR doesn't appear / shows "no session"** — the sidecar's
  `/session/connect` endpoint hasn't fired yet. Hit
  **Refresh** on the admin page once or twice; the plugin's
  `admin_qrcodelink` handler retries the connect call before
  returning the QR.
- **QR scanned but no inbound** — check that Signal-cli's
  read-receipts feature flipped on. The plugin ships an
  `enable-read-receipts.sh` script as a stage-mounted file
  inside the sidecar; the supervisor runs it on first health.
  If you see `Sidecar healthy` but no read receipts after sending
  yourself a test message, redeploy the plugin
  (uninstall → re-upload → enable) so the script re-runs.
- **Unpair + re-pair** — Settings → Plugins → Signal → Danger
  zone → **Unregister account**. Drops the sidecar's stored
  identity. Re-running the QR flow links a fresh device slot.

## WhatsApp (wuzapi sidecar)

WhatsApp Multi-Device transport via the wuzapi Go wrapper around
whatsmeow. Same QR pattern as Signal but with a webhook-based inbound
event delivery (wuzapi has no WebSocket event surface).

### Steps

1. **Install + enable** `plugins/whatsapp/`. The wuzapi sidecar
   (`asternic/wuzapi:latest`) starts on host port `:8502`. SQLite
   state for paired sessions persists under
   `~/.execlaw/sidecars/whatsapp/wuzapi/data/`.

2. Open **Settings → Plugins → WhatsApp**. The page polls the same
   `/api/admin/plugins/whatsapp/status` admin route.

3. The plugin auto-provisions a wuzapi user (`execlaw`) and registers
   the webhook callback URL on first enable. Wait for status to show
   `Sidecar healthy` and `Webhook registered`.

4. Click **Pair**. The QR data URL is rendered, fetched from
   `/api/admin/plugins/whatsapp/qrcodelink`.

5. On your phone: WhatsApp → **Settings → Linked devices → Link a
   device** → scan.

6. Status flips to `Logged in as <your number>` and the JID
   (`<number>:<device>@s.whatsapp.net`) appears on the page.

7. Send yourself a test message. You should see typing indicator,
   read receipt (single → double-blue tick), and the agent's reply.

### Common pitfalls

- **`already connected` 500 on connect** — non-issue; the plugin
  swallows it as the desired state. If you see it surface in the SPA
  it's a UI bug worth filing.
- **Inbound messages not reaching the agent** — wuzapi's webhook
  retries failed deliveries (default 5 × 30 s; bumped to 10 × 30 s
  via `WEBHOOK_RETRY_COUNT` in plugin.toml). If execlaw was down
  longer than the retry envelope, the messages WhatsApp's servers
  buffered will replay through wuzapi on next reconnect — give it
  a minute. If still nothing, check
  `docker logs execlaw-sidecar-whatsapp-wuzapi | grep "Calling user webhook"`.
- **Duplicate replies** — check the plugin version is `0.1.7+` (the
  pre-fix version blocks the webhook on the agent's whole turn,
  causing wuzapi to time out and retry). Reinstall from the latest
  `dist/whatsapp-*.zip` if needed.
- **`webhook=""` empty in `/admin/users`** — manifest uses old
  field names. Plugin must be `0.1.3+` (uses `webhookurl` not
  `webhook`, `events` not `subscribe`).

## Slack (Socket Mode + multi-workspace)

Slack transport uses Socket Mode — no public URL required, no
incoming webhooks, no sidecar. Each workspace pairs independently
via OAuth.

### One-time: create a Slack app

1. Go to <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Create New App** → **From
   scratch**. Name it (e.g. `execlaw`), pick a workspace.

2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**:
   - Add scopes: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `chat:write`,
     `files:read`, `im:history`, `mpim:history`, `groups:history`,
     `channels:history`, `users:read`.
   - Click **Install to Workspace** (or "Reinstall" if scopes
     change later).
   - Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`).

3. Under **Basic Information** → **App-Level Tokens** →
   **Generate Token and Scopes**. Add the `connections:write` scope
   (Socket Mode requirement). Copy the **App-Level Token**
   (`xapp-…`).

4. Under **Socket Mode** — toggle **Enable Socket Mode** on.

5. Under **Event Subscriptions** — toggle **Enable Events** on. Add
   bot events: `message.channels`, `message.groups`, `message.im`,
   `message.mpim`. Save.

### Pair the workspace in execlaw

1. Open **Settings → Plugins → Slack**.

2. Click **Add workspace** → paste the Bot User OAuth Token
   (`xoxb-…`) and the App-Level Token (`xapp-…`). Save.

3. The plugin opens a Socket Mode connection on the operator's
   behalf and registers the workspace under its team ID. Subsequent
   inbound messages on bot-invited channels arrive as agent
   inbound.

4. To invite the bot to a channel: in Slack, type
   `/invite @<bot-name>`. The agent will see DMs without an invite.

### Common pitfalls

- **Token rejected** — scopes don't match. Re-install the app to the
  workspace after editing scopes; tokens minted before a scope
  change don't gain the new scope.
- **No inbound** — the bot wasn't invited to the channel. DM works
  out of the box; channel/group messages need an invite.
- **"app not enabled for Socket Mode"** — toggle in step 4 above.
  Without it the App-Level Token can't open the WebSocket.
- **Multi-workspace** — the plugin supports N workspaces in
  parallel; each uses a separate token pair stored under its team
  ID in the vault.

## SMS (Android-side WebSocket gateway)

SMS transport uses a companion Android app
([`sms-socket-app`](https://github.com/crockpotveggies/sms-socket-app))
running on a phone with a SIM. The phone exposes a WebSocket gateway on
the local network; execlaw connects out to it. The GitHub project currently
publishes source code, not a downloadable APK, so the app must be built and
installed from source unless you already have an APK from a trusted build.

### Steps

1. Install Android Studio, Android SDK 36, Android SDK Build-Tools 36,
   Android NDK 27.1.12297006, Node.js 22.11+, and Git on the Windows host.
   Clone the app and build its debug APK:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/crockpotveggies/sms-socket-app.git
   cd sms-socket-app
   npm install
   adb devices
   npm run android
   ```

   `npm run android` installs the debug APK directly when an Android phone
   with USB debugging enabled is connected. To build the APK without the
   React Native CLI, run `cd android; .\gradlew.bat assembleDebug`; the APK
   is `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`, which can be
   installed with `adb install -r android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`.

2. Open the app on an Android phone with a SIM. Grant the default SMS role,
   SMS/phone permissions, and notifications when prompted. Do not start the
   gateway until the app has become the default SMS app.

3. In the app, set an API key and start the gateway. Disable battery
   optimization for the app. The gateway listens on port `8787`; use the
   phone's Wi-Fi IP in execlaw, for example
   `ws://192.168.1.42:8787/`. `127.0.0.1` means the execlaw host itself,
   not the phone. Both devices must be on the same LAN. For USB testing,
   `adb reverse tcp:8787 tcp:8787` permits `ws://127.0.0.1:8787/`.

4. Open **Settings → Plugins → SMS Socket**. Paste the gateway URL and the
   API key. Leave **Default SIM subscription id** blank unless the phone has
   multiple SIMs and you need to select a particular subscription. Save.

5. The plugin's `on_enable` connects, runs a `getGatewayState`
   handshake, and issues a `rehydrate` request to pull any messages
   the gateway buffered since the last cursor. Status shows the
   phone's connection state, last-seen timestamp, and inbound count.

### Common pitfalls

- **Phone goes to sleep** — Android battery optimization will kill
  the gateway. Disable battery optimization for the
  `sms-socket-app` in Android Settings → Battery → Battery
  optimization → All apps → execlaw SMS → Don't optimize.
- **WebSocket keeps disconnecting** — usually a network issue (Wi-Fi
  drops, phone changes networks). The plugin auto-reconnects and
  re-anchors the rehydrate cursor; the host log shows
  `sms-socket: anchoring rehydrate cursor at <ms>`.
- **Duplicate inbound on reconnect** — the plugin's rehydrate cursor
  prevents this from `0.1.0+`; older builds replayed history on
  every reconnect. Update if you see it.

## Google Apps / Google Places

The Google integrations consolidate into two plugins:

- `google-apps` — OAuth, single grant covering Gmail, Calendar,
  Contacts, Tasks, and Drive. **Also an identity provider** (resolves
  inbound email/phone to a known contact via the People API). Replaces
  the legacy `google-calendar` + `google-contacts` plugins (removed
  2026-05-14).
- `google-places` — **API key only**, no OAuth. Search nearby
  businesses + place details.

### One-time: create a Google Cloud project

1. <https://console.cloud.google.com/> → **Create project** (or use
   an existing one).

2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable each of (for `google-apps`):
   - **Gmail API**
   - **Google Calendar API**
   - **People API**
   - **Tasks API**
   - **Google Drive API**

   And for `google-places`:
   - **Places API (New)**

3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** (for `google-apps`):
   - User type: **External** (single-operator deployment is fine
     under "Testing" status indefinitely).
   - Scopes: add the scopes `google-apps` requests (gmail, calendar,
     contacts, tasks, drive).
   - Test users: add the operator's Google account email.

4. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials**:
   - For OAuth: **OAuth client ID** → **Desktop app** type. Copy
     the client ID + client secret.
   - For Places (API-key plugin): **API key**. Restrict it to
     **Places API (New)** under API restrictions.

### Pair google-apps in execlaw

1. **Settings → Plugins → Google Apps**.

2. Paste the OAuth client ID + client secret. Redirect URI defaults
   to `http://localhost:3031/api/oauth/google/callback`. Save.

3. Click **Authorize**. A new browser tab opens to Google's consent
   screen. Sign in as the operator account, grant the requested
   scopes.

4. Google redirects back to `http://localhost:3031/api/oauth/google/callback`.
   The host's OAuth handler exchanges the code for a refresh +
   access token, stores them in the vault keyed on
   `(plugin_id="google-apps", account_name="controller")`.

5. Per-module toggles surface in the same panel (Calendar /
   Contacts / Gmail / Tasks / Drive can be enabled or disabled
   without re-running the consent flow).

6. The plugin's tools become available to the agent on the next turn.

### Configure google-places

1. **Settings → Plugins → Google Places**.

2. Paste the API key. The plugin issues a 1-result `coffee` text
   search to validate the key + scope before saving.

3. Save. The agent can immediately call `google_places.search`,
   `.nearby`, and `.details` tools.

### Common pitfalls

- **"redirect_uri_mismatch"** — Google's OAuth client config rejects
  any redirect URI not in its allow-list. The dev / production
  default is `http://localhost:3031/api/oauth/google/callback`.
  If you bound the control plane to a different port via Settings
  → General, update the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console to
  match.
- **Refresh token never arrives** — Google only returns a refresh
  token on the *first* OAuth grant. If you've previously authorized
  the same client + same Google account, revoke the prior grant at
  <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions> and re-authorize.
- **API key 403** — for Places, the key wasn't restricted to
  Places API or the API isn't enabled in the project. Both are
  fixed in Cloud Console.
- **Identity provider not auto-resolving** — `google-apps` includes
  an identity provider, but the host only consults it when the
  inbound transport handle is an email or phone (per the
  `[identity_provider].resolves` manifest field). Inbound from
  WhatsApp/Signal/Slack uses transport-specific resolution paths
  first; google-apps is a fallback.
- **Migrating from the old `google-calendar` / `google-contacts`
  plugins** — those were removed in 2026-05-14. Uninstall both,
  install `google-apps`, re-run the OAuth pairing once. Tool names
  changed: `calendar.list_calendars`, `contacts.list`, etc. now
  live under the `google-apps` plugin id, but the agent-facing
  tool names themselves are unchanged.

## After-pairing sanity checks

For any of the above:

```bash
# Confirm the plugin is enabled + sidecar (if any) is healthy:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3031/api/admin/plugins | jq '.plugins[] | select(.enabled)'

# Watch the live log for inbound:
tail -f ~/.execlaw/logs/execlaw.jsonl.<today>

# Send yourself a test message and look for:
#   "<plugin>: webhook hit ENTERED" / "<plugin>: ws-frame received"
#   "host_route_inbound outcome=Dispatched"
#   "auto-bridged agent text reply via originating transport"
```

If any of those three log lines is missing for a transport you've
just paired, file a [bug
report](https://github.com/crockpotveggies/execlaw/issues/new?template=bug.yml)
with the relevant log excerpt.
