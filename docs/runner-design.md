# Runner system design notes

What execlaw inherits from selfhosted-claw's `HotRunnerPool`, what it
fixes, and the optimisations the original author baked in that we
must not lose in the Rust port.

The selfhosted-claw runner code is the **most performance-tuned**
subsystem in the predecessor project. Every entry below was
hard-won, often through a production incident — preserve the
intent, even when the Rust idiom for implementing it differs.

## Implementation delivery plan

All H001-H130 are accepted scope in [`implementation-plan.md`](implementation-plan.md).
The predecessor examples and environment-variable names below are historical
design context, not current configuration instructions. New operator settings
belong in SQLite. Implementation does not imply production qualification.

Runner delivery is governed by [H023 shared execution/recovery](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-023),
[H029 streaming](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-029),
[H030 scheduling](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-030),
[H068 independent tool work](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-068),
[H069 clocks](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-069),
[H072 isolation](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-072),
[H075 shutdown](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-075), and
[H087 deadlock handling](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-087).
Use the real container runner and in-process path in acceptance tests; F07,
F10, and F11 remain open recovery/streaming/cancellation work. Preserve event
pairing and effect reconciliation when a worker is replaced.

## 1. Per-conversation isolation, automatic lifecycle

Each conversation (group) gets **its own runner**. Selfhosted-claw
proved this is the right unit of isolation — data from group A
cannot leak into group B's runner via shared memory, file
descriptors, or errant tool-call routing.

| Group | Lifecycle |
|---|---|
| **Controller direct** | Runner stays hot **indefinitely**. No idle reap. The operator's primary thread is the most latency-sensitive surface. |
| **All other groups** (cold contacts, KnownTrusted DMs, group chats) | Hot for **~10 min idle**, then reaped. Configurable via `HOT_RUNNER_POOL_IDLE_TTL_MS`. |
| **Voice sessions** | Stay hot for the duration of the call. Voice has different latency budgets — see §10. |

The operator **does not create runners**. The control plane spawns
on demand and reaps on idle. The Settings → Runners page is
view-only with a restart button (force-reap when one is stuck).

## 2. Hot pool with prewarmed minIdle

`HotRunnerPool` (selfhosted-claw `src/runner/common/hot-runner-pool.ts`):

- **`minIdle`** (default 1, env `HOT_RUNNER_POOL_MIN_IDLE`) — at least
  one runner is always warm, ready to accept the next conversation.
- **`maxSize`** (default 2) — cap on concurrent runners. Beyond this,
  requesters wait on a promise queue with a 2-minute watchdog.
- **Synchronous waiter wake-up** — when a runner returns to idle, the
  pool resolves the oldest waiter's promise immediately rather than
  letting the event loop poll. Comment: "avoids up-to-25ms polling
  jitter when the pool is saturated."
- **TTL eviction** — sessions idle for > `idleTtlMs` (default 5 min)
  are closed, except the floor `minIdle` always survives.

**Rust port intent:** mirror the same semantics in `container-manager`
crate. `RunnerPool` keeps a `min_idle` of warm containers; `max_size`
caps concurrency; `idle_ttl` evicts; the controller's runner is
exempt from the TTL.

## 3. Pre-warming — checksum-based recompile avoidance

Selfhosted-claw's runner Dockerfile + `entrypoint.sh` implement a
clever fast path for "code didn't change since the image was built":

```
# Dockerfile build step
RUN find src -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.json" \) \
    -printf '%s %T@ %p\n' | sort | md5sum > /app/.src-checksum

# entrypoint.sh on container start
NEW_CHECKSUM=$(find /app/src -type f ... | sort | md5sum)
if [ "$NEW_CHECKSUM" = "$(cat /app/.src-checksum)" ] && [ -f /app/dist/index.js ]; then
    DIST_DIR=/app/dist          # use prebuilt
else
    npx tsc -p /app -d /tmp/dist  # recompile to /tmp
    DIST_DIR=/tmp/dist
fi
```

Comment in the entrypoint: `"~10–30x faster than md5sum'ing every
TS file"` — stat-based fingerprint (size + mtime + path) instead of
hashing file contents.

**Saves 1–3s of TypeScript compilation per cold start.** For
prewarmed containers it's the difference between sub-50ms and
~2-second handoff.

**Rust port intent:** less critical because Rust runners are AOT
compiled. The analogous optimisation is the **plugin install path**
where ZIP staging may need similar checksum-based skip-if-unchanged
logic for `.customized` plugin variants.

## 4. Selective bind-mounts (no recursive copies)

Two earlier attempts FAILED:

1. `bind-mount project root :ro + shadow .env via /dev/null`. **runc
   refuses to create a mount point inside an RO parent** — kernel
   constraint, not configurable.
2. `fs.cpSync(projectRoot, mountTarget)` on every spawn. **Blocks
   the Node event loop for hundreds of ms on a real project**;
   control plane stalls under load.

The shipped strategy mounts only the subpaths the runner actually
needs:
- `/workspace/group` (writable, per-group folder)
- `/workspace/state` (writable, per-group runtime state)
- `/workspace/ipc` (writable, per-group IPC dir)
- `/workspace/global` (RO, optional shared notes)
- `/workspace/controller-notes` (RO, only for non-controller groups, points at controller's folder)
- `/app/dist` from the image; only **opt-in** customisations re-mount
  via a `.customized` marker file (avoids legacy snapshot recompile
  for groups that haven't actually changed anything).

**Rust port intent:** carry the principle. The container-manager
must NOT recursively copy the workspace per spawn. Bind-mount only
what's needed; everything else stays in the image.

## 5. State externalization — runners are stateless against the log

This is the biggest *correction* over selfhosted-claw. Their runners
were **stateful mid-run**: a crash mid-turn dropped work and left
cursors out of sync.

execlaw fixes that:

- **Event log is the source of truth.** The runner reconstructs
  context from `state_events` on spawn (~10–50ms hydration).
- **No persistent state inside the container.** Memory, scratchpad,
  and turn outputs are committed via `commit_turn` to the event log
  before the runner declares the turn done.
- **Crash → respawn is safe.** A crashed runner gets its open
  `tool_use` paired with a synthesized cancellation `tool_result`;
  the next runner picks up exactly where the log left off, no double
  execution.

What still goes to disk (carried over from selfhosted-claw):

- **Per-group IPC directory** (`/data/ipc/{group_folder}/{input,messages,responses,tasks}`)
  — used for streaming output and inter-container signalling. **Each
  group's IPC is isolated** from every other group's; one group's
  compromise can't reach another's IPC.

**Rust port intent:** runner-local crate already gets this right;
TurnExecutor + commit_turn already form the transactional boundary.

## 6. Per-group queue serialization with global concurrency cap

`GroupQueue` (selfhosted-claw `src/group-queue.ts`) enforces:

- **Strict per-group order** — two messages for the same group never
  race through different runners. While a group is active, new
  messages set `pendingMessages = true`; on completion, `drainGroup`
  re-runs if more arrived.
- **Global concurrency cap** (`MAX_CONCURRENT_CONTAINERS`, default 5)
  — overflow groups join `waitingGroups[]`. On the next slot
  release, `drainWaiting()` schedules the next.
- **Task de-duplication by id** — preventing the scheduler from
  spawning two containers for the same task.
- **Idle-waiting state** — a running container can signal it's
  waiting for further IPC. Tasks that arrive during idle close
  stdin (write `_close` sentinel) to wake the loop without
  respawning.

- **Crash recovery: exponential backoff + cooldown** — 5s, 10s, 20s,
  40s, 80s, then 10-min cooldown. After cooldown, retry counter
  resets. Prevents a permanently-broken group from saturating Docker
  logs.

**Rust port intent:** the `WakeupScheduler` in `crates/outbox` plus
the conversation-resolver pinning logic already enforce per-group
ordering. The global concurrency cap + cooldown semantics need to
go into the runner-spawn path explicitly.

## 7. Streaming output via sentinel markers

Container output is wrapped in `---NANOCLAW_OUTPUT_START---` /
`---NANOCLAW_OUTPUT_END---`. Control plane parses incrementally as
chunks arrive, so:

- Results are delivered the moment they finish, not on container exit.
- Activity-based timeout reset: every parsed output marker resets
  the hard timeout. A long-running tool call that produces partial
  outputs is recognised as alive.
- **Stderr does NOT reset the timeout.** Comment: "SDK writes debug
  logs continuously. Don't let chatty debug noise keep a hung
  container alive forever."
- **"Crashed but already produced output" is not a failure.** A
  container that emits results and then dies is treated as "idle
  cleanup," not error. Avoids spurious error logs.

**Current Rust paths:** `runner-binary` runs separately and exchanges typed
`runner-protocol` frames with `server/src/runner_supervisor.rs`; the in-process
`runner-local` executor also remains. The predecessor's text sentinels are not
the current wire contract. H023/H029 qualify shared completion, timeout, and
streaming semantics rather than treating partial output as successful work.

## 8. Resource hygiene

- `--rm` on every container spawn — Docker cleans up exited
  containers automatically.
- Background reaper (`reapStaleContainers`, every 5 min) — kills any
  container older than 45 min that the control plane lost track of
  (daemon crash, etc.).
- Output size capped at `CONTAINER_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE` (10 MB). Stops
  accumulating after the cap; doesn't crash.
- Async log writes — never block the control plane on disk I/O.

**Rust port intent:** the container-manager crate should mirror this.
A periodic sweeper alongside `LogRetentionSweeper` /
`RefreshTokenSweeper` / `EphemeralSweeper` that reaps orphaned
containers.

### 8.1 Local inference admission (H030)

Resolved inference clients share a bounded global semaphore and per-model
semaphores. Background work has a smaller lane; requests waiting longer than
the aging threshold can enter the shared lane so background work does not
starve. Child inference requests carry the durable parent-run scope and hold
one of two sibling permits until the request or stream is dropped. Parent
token reservations are persisted in SQLite and charge measured prompt plus
completion usage; missing usage consumes the full reservation. Time, retry,
and effect limits persist with each run and are consumed before retry or tool
dispatch. Child reservations cover aggregate tokens, wall time, retries, and
effects; delegated inference shares the parent scope, and children cannot
dispatch effects. Docker runner launch applies a memory cap and serializes
admission against live RAM and active reservations. Per-tier queue-delay
qualification remains an H030 acceptance item.

## 9. Activity-based timeouts (NOT wall-clock)

Two timeouts in selfhosted-claw:

- `IDLE_TIMEOUT` — reset on every output marker. Generous default
  (30s) because tool calls can be slow.
- `HARD_TIMEOUT` — `max(configTimeout, IDLE_TIMEOUT + 30s)`. Even if
  the container is producing output, force-kill at this point. Catch
  for runaway tool loops.

The 30-second cushion before hard kill **lets graceful shutdown
complete** so any final output is captured before SIGKILL.

**Rust port intent:** `tokio::time::timeout` paired with a sentinel-
reset channel. Same two-tier semantic.

## 10. Voice runner — different from text

Voice has hard real-time constraints. The voice runner's tuning:

- **Session lifetime: minutes, not seconds.** Voice calls stay open;
  the runner accumulates transcript + tool-history in memory across
  many RPC turns within one call.
- **Streaming-first.** Text chunks and audio samples ship as soon as
  the LLM emits them. **Filler audio** (`filler_delay_ms = 150ms`)
  fills dead air while the model thinks. Without this, the caller
  hears uncomfortable silence.
- **Token budget per turn** (`MAX_TOKENS_INITIAL = 1200`). Comment
  in `live-runner.ts:265-281`: "production incidents where Qwen3's
  uncontrolled `<think>` blocks consumed the entire budget,
  producing silent turns. The ceiling is defense in depth."
- **History windowing.** Last 6 turns sent verbatim; up to 60 kept
  for background digest. Older context gets summarised so the
  prompt stays bounded.
- **Digest timeout** (`DIGEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 10s`). Background summary
  task is aborted if it can't finish in 10s, so a slow summariser
  never blocks the next turn.

**Rust port intent:** the `voice-pipeline` crate already has the
two-lane graph + endpointer + barge-in primitives. The remaining
work is wiring the runner-side analogues of:

- Filler audio while the model thinks (Phase 9 with real `service-kokoro`).
- Per-turn token ceiling in the runner's `TurnConfig`.
- History windowing in `runner-local::memory_tool` (already trust-class scoped).
- Digest task with hard timeout.

## 11. Other hard-won lessons (from comments)

- **Per-group customisation must be opt-in.** A `.customized` marker
  file in the group's runner-source dir tells the entrypoint to
  recompile. Without the marker, every group would force a recompile
  on first start because most groups have legacy snapshot copies of
  the default runner that aren't actually customised.

- **Bind-mount the controller's notes RO into non-controller groups,
  not the other way.** Non-controller groups can read controller
  preferences (contacts, names, etc.) but can never write to the
  controller's folder.

- **The same runner image serves both text and voice.** Voice is
  not a different binary; it's the same runner reading from the
  voice-pipeline graph instead of the chat WS. Image proliferation
  was rejected.

- **Per-group cooldown after retry exhaustion** — once a group has
  failed 5 times in a row, it's locked out for 10 minutes
  regardless of new messages. Comment: "prevents one broken group
  from saturating logs and starving healthy groups."

## 12. Summary — what to carry to the Rust port

1. **Per-conversation runner with auto lifecycle.** Operator never
   creates one.
2. **Controller's runner is always hot.** Other groups: 10-min idle
   reap.
3. **Hot pool with prewarmed `min_idle`** — at least one warm
   runner ready, capped at `max_size`, immediate waiter wake.
4. **Stateless against the event log.** Hydration on spawn, no
   persistent in-runner state.
5. **Selective bind-mounts** — never recursive copies, never the
   whole project root.
6. **Per-group IPC isolation** — each group's IPC dir is its own.
7. **Per-group serialization + global concurrency cap + cooldown**
   on persistent failure.
8. **Streaming output with sentinel markers + activity-based
   timeout reset.** Stderr does not count as activity.
9. **Background reaper** alongside the existing sweepers, killing
   orphaned containers older than ~45 min.
10. **Voice-specific tuning**: session-long lifetime, fillers, token
    ceiling per turn, history windowing with bounded digest.

These items belong to the `container-manager` and `runner-local`
crates. The Settings → Runners page is the operator surface for
**observing** them; it must not have create/delete affordances.
