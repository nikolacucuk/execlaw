# Voice mode — known follow-ups

Phase 13.A–13.D shipped end-to-end voice mode with these explicit deferrals.
Each item below is intentionally out of scope for the initial commit; the
hooks are in place so the follow-up is a focused addition rather than a
rewrite.

## 13.E — Server-side WebRTC AEC3 (deferred)

**Status**: deferred to a later phase (13.E-later).

**Why deferred**: WebRTC AEC3 is C++ in upstream WebRTC. Rust bindings are
sparse — `webrtc-audio-processing` lags upstream and Windows builds are
flaky. Honest paths forward are (1) a multi-day FFI yak shave around the
upstream `audio_processing` C++ tree, or (2) a sidecar `service-aec3`
microservice. Neither is justified before voice mode is in active use.

**Current behavior**: browser AEC stays OFF (operator's locked decision in
[`feedback_voice_mode_model`]). The practical implication today is that
**headphones are required** during voice conversations, otherwise the
agent's TTS audio will pick up in the mic and Whisper will transcribe its
own speech. This is acceptable for dogfood; the AEC3 follow-up unlocks
hands-free desktop + speakerphone setups.

**When to revisit**: when phone-bridge (Bluetooth → execlaw) sources land,
because phone audio comes back in the mic by definition and we can't
require headphones on a phone bridge.

## SPA mic capture: PCM16 (completed)

**Status**: `VoiceCaptureButton` captures browser audio samples and converts
them to PCM16 before sending them to the server. Server-side
`voice_runtime::ingest_chunks` accepts the resulting `pcm16le` / `pcm16`
frames.

The former MediaRecorder/Opus compatibility gap is closed. Future codec work
would be an optimization for bandwidth, not a prerequisite for Whisper input.

## Continuous VAD-driven endpointing (deferred)

**Status**: v1 voice mode is push-to-talk. The SPA's mic toggle generates
the `voice_stop` control message; the server's voice_runtime flushes
Whisper on receipt.

**Follow-up**: server-side WebRTC-VAD (or Silero ONNX in the
`voice-pipeline` crate, which already has the `Vad` trait) auto-endpoints
on silence so the operator can speak hands-free. Wire format change is
zero — same `voice_stop` UiEvent, just emitted by the server instead of
the SPA.

## Real chat-path agent reply on voice_stop (deferred)

**Status**: the `voice_stop` control handler currently echoes the
transcript back as `you said: <text>` instead of routing through the
chat / runner / LLM path. Verifies the round-trip without coupling
`voice_runtime` to `chats::dispatch_turn`.

**Follow-up**: replace the echo callback with a thin adapter that opens a
conversation against the controller's thread, posts the transcript as a
`ChatMessageInbound`, and consumes the resulting `ChatTokenDelta` /
`ChatMessageOutbound` stream as the TTS source. The voice pipeline already
streams TTS chunks per call; the adapter just feeds it the runner's
output sentence-by-sentence.

## Streaming TTS feedback to the runner (deferred)

**Status**: barge-in fires `KokoroClient::cancel()` and SPA-side
`VoicePlayback.flush()`, but the runner doesn't know how much of its
reply was actually heard before the interrupt.

**Follow-up**: track `played_through_sentence` in the runtime's
session state (incremented when Kokoro's audio chunk for sentence N has
finished synthesizing). On `voice_interrupt`, log a structured
`VoiceInterrupted { played_through_sentence: u32 }` event so future
analytics can distinguish "user barged in immediately" from "user heard
most of it." Conversation history then truncates the agent's "outbound"
message to the actually-heard prefix, matching what humans would do.
