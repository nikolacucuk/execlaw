# Automations

Event-triggered flows. Webhooks, routines, plugin emits, and socket
messages land on a durable bus; matching automations run a typed graph
that can filter, transform, branch, or hand off to the agent. Every
normal run produces a persisted per-step trace; the current Test run path
returns an in-memory trace and can still perform live effects.

## Implementation delivery plan

All H001-H130 are accepted scope in [`implementation-plan.md`](implementation-plan.md).
Automation delivery covers [H023 recovery](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-023),
[H026 authorization](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-026),
[H052 live authority](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-052),
[H069 clocks](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-069),
[H070 routine scheduling](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-070),
[H103 trigger bursts](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-103),
[H124 workflow revisions](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-124),
[H125 durable control nodes](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-125), and
[H126 effect-free simulation](llm-harness-roadmap.md#enhancement-126).
Existing nodes are implementation, not qualification: F08 identifies lost
claimed work, F18 identifies live Test run effects without a run row, and F19
identifies unauthenticated automation execution with Controller tool authority.
Close those boundaries before treating the editor as a safe preview surface.
The linked tracker owns delivery order, status, and evidence.

Use cases the design serves:

- **Ring → animal watch.** Webhook delivers an image, an `AskAgent`
  node decides "animal present?" against a vision model, the flow
  routes to a notification or drops silently.
- **Slack triage.** Mention webhook → agent classifies → appends a
  card to a per-team chat conversation.
- **Routine reactions.** A scheduled routine fires its prompt; an
  automation listening for `routine.fired` reads the outcome and
  branches on success/failure.
- **Discovery.** Events with no matching automation surface on the
  `/automations` landing page as suggestions; one click seeds an
  editor pre-filled with the trigger.

Reference architecture: **LangGraph**. We borrowed the conditional-
edge + state-graph model but the runtime is pure Rust — LangGraph is
studied, not embedded. The code-view in the editor renders our internal
`AutomationDef` JSON, not Python.


## Building blocks

### Event bus (M1)

Owned by `crates/core/src/automation_bus.rs` (data layer) and
`crates/server/src/automation_bus.rs` (dispatch + poller).

| Concept | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Event` envelope | `core::automation_bus::Event` | `id` (PK / dedup), `kind`, `source`, `received_at`, `payload`. Producers pick `id` — content hash for dedup, ULID otherwise. |
| `BusEventKind` enum | `core::automation_bus::BusEventKind` | `WebhookReceived` / `SocketMessage` / `PluginEmit` / `RoutineFired` / `Other`. Serialized as the wire string (`"webhook.received"` etc.). |
| `state_bus_events` table | migration 0007 | PK on `id`. Two indexes: `(kind, received_at)` for the matcher, and a partial `(internal, received_at) WHERE dispatched_at IS NULL` for the crash-recovery scan. |
| `AutomationBus::publish` | `server::automation_bus` | Persists first (durability), then sends id over mpsc (backpressure). Internal producers (in-process emits) skip the channel; a 100 ms poller picks them up. |
| Race guard | `BusEventStore::mark_dispatched` returns `bool` | Claim-before-handle: only the caller whose UPDATE flipped `dispatched_at` runs the handler. Guarantees at-most-once handler invocation even when the recovery scan races a live mpsc delivery. |
| Retention | `core::bus_event_retention::BusEventRetentionSweeper` | Daily tick; uses the global `history_retention_days` setting. Only dispatched rows eligible — pending rows survive a stuck dispatcher. |


### Graph runtime (M2)

Owned by `crates/core/src/automations.rs` (data + validator) and
`crates/server/src/automation_runtime.rs` (executor).

**`AutomationDef`** is the typed graph stored as JSON in
`state_automations.definition`:

```jsonc
{
  "trigger": { "kind": "webhook.received", "when": "event.source == \"ring\"" },
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "filter1",  "kind": "Filter",   "config": { "expr": "event.payload.confidence > 0.5" } },
    { "id": "decide",   "kind": "AskAgent", "config": { /* see AskAgentConfig */ } },
    { "id": "notify",   "kind": "Terminal", "config": {} },
    { "id": "ignored",  "kind": "Terminal", "config": {} }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": "trigger",  "to": "filter1" },
    { "from": "filter1",  "to": "decide" },
    { "from": "decide",   "to": "notify",  "when": "decide.tool == \"notify\"" },
    { "from": "decide",   "to": "ignored" }
  ]
}
```

**Implemented node kinds (M2 + M3):**

| Kind | Config | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Filter` | `{ expr: "<rhai bool>" }` | False → run drops to `skipped`. |
| `Transform` | `{ expr: "<rhai value>" }` | Value lands in `state[node_id]`, available to downstream nodes/edges. |
| `Branch` | `{}` | No-op routing junction. Outgoing edges' `when` clauses do the actual routing. |
| `Terminal` | `{}` | Explicit end; flow status becomes `success`. (Implicit end happens when no edge matches.) |
| `AskAgent` | `AskAgentConfig` | Hands off to the LLM; see below. |
| `Notify` | See `execute_notify` in `automation_runtime.rs` | Writes a production alert. |
| `CallPlugin` | See `execute_call_plugin` in `automation_runtime.rs` | Invokes a registered plugin tool; authority requires F19 remediation. |
| `HttpFetch` | See `execute_http_fetch` in `automation_runtime.rs` | Performs an HTTP request, including configured mutating methods. |

**Reserved kinds** (validator rejects with `NotYetImplemented` —
schema slots reserved for future work): `AppendToChat`, `AwaitApproval`,
`CallAutomation`, `Parallel`, `Join`.

**Edge routing.** Each edge has an optional `when` Rhai bool. The
executor picks the first edge whose `when` is truthy (or has none).
No matching edge = implicit end.

**Expression sandbox.** Rhai engine constructed fresh per call with hard caps:
100k ops, depth 32, 64 KB strings, 10k array/map size. No host
capabilities, no I/O within those expressions. Tested via a runaway-loop test.
This does not make the complete graph effect-free: effectful nodes use host APIs.

**Trace sink.** Same executor body powers live runs (DB checkpoint
via `AutomationRunStore::append_trace`) and dry runs (in-memory
`Vec<StepTrace>`). The seam is a `&mut dyn FnMut(StepTrace)` closure.


### AskAgent (M3)

Owned by `crates/server/src/automation_agent.rs`.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct AskAgentConfig {
    pub prompt: String,
    pub attachments: Vec<String>,     // data: URLs or https:// URLs
    pub reasoning_tools: Vec<String>, // reserved; single-turn M3a
    pub exit_tools: Vec<ExitToolDef>, // agent MUST call exactly one
    pub max_turns: Option<u32>,       // default 3; M3a caps at 1
}
```

The agent picks one exit tool. The chosen tool's name becomes
`<node_id>.tool` in state (routes the outgoing edge via `when:
"ask.tool == \"notify\""`); the args become `<node_id>.args.*`.

**Pool & concurrency.** All AskAgent calls funnel through
`AutomationsAgentPool` — a tokio `Semaphore` (default 1). Production
constructs the pool around `InferenceAgentInvoker`; tests use
`StubAgentInvoker`. Per-flow `reasoning_tools` must be a subset of
the `KnownLimited` trust profile's allowed list (enforced at invoke
time).

**Vision routing (M5).** When `attachments` is non-empty, the
invoker resolves `BackendPurpose::Vision` first:

1. Vision row present + has endpoint → use it. Operator's intent is
   the source of truth; no heuristic.
2. Vision row absent → resolve `Standard` and apply the M3a
   model-id heuristic. Text-only-by-name → fail fast with
   `VisionRequiredButTextOnlyModel` and a message that points the
   operator at Settings → Backends.
3. Vision-from-bootstrap is rejected — the resolver's bootstrap
   fallback is the Standard URL, not a vision backend.

**Templating.** Prompt + attachments pass through `render_template`
before reaching the invoker, so authors can write
`{{event.payload.image_url}}` in the JSON and have it resolved at
execute time against the run's state map.

**Single-turn in M3a.** `max_turns` ≥ 1 is treated as 1. The
multi-turn loop with intermediate reasoning-tool execution is a
follow-up; the framework is sized for it (the `effective_max_turns`
field rides through the request).


### Discovery & suggestions (M4a + M5)

Owned by `crates/core/src/automation_suggestions.rs` (sweep +
store) and `crates/server/src/automation_suggestions_sweeper.rs`
(actor).

The daily sweep walks the last 7 days of `state_bus_events`, groups
by `(kind, source)`, and surfaces patterns that:

1. Have ≥ 10 events in the window;
2. Have no enabled automation for that kind;
3. Aren't in `state_automation_muted_patterns`.

Each survivor lands in `state_automation_suggestions` (upsert is
idempotent — re-sweep refreshes counts on the existing row). The
landing page reads `list_pending()`; the "Review and create" click
opens the editor with `?suggestion=<id>` and pre-fills the trigger
kind.

**Dismiss-mutes-pattern.** Dismissing a suggestion flips its status
AND inserts the `(kind, source)` into the muted-patterns table. The
next sweep skips it. Operators can later un-mute (no UI yet — direct
DB or the future settings sub-page).

**Agent-drafted seed (M5 scaffold).** Migration 0010 adds a nullable
`draft_definition` column. `SuggestionStore::set_draft_definition`
is the seam an agent-drafting path writes through; the SPA editor
seeds its JSON from `draft_definition` when present (falls back to
`emptyAutomationDef(kind)`). The actual LLM call that produces drafts
is a follow-up — the scaffolding lets that change land without
touching the schema or the frontend.


### Test-run (M4c)

Owned by `crates/server/src/automation_runtime.rs::dry_run` +
`crates/server/src/automations_admin.rs::test_run`.

The editor's "Test run" button POSTs to
`/api/admin/automations/{id}/test-run` with either an `event_id`
(picked from `/recent-events`) or a synthesized `sample_event`. The
endpoint runs the executor against the chosen event with an in-memory
trace sink, without creating a durable automation-run row. The result is the
trace + outcome JSON, surfaced inline in the canvas drawer. This is not an
effect-free simulation: `AskAgent` uses the configured model, `Notify` can
write production alerts, and `CallPlugin`/`HttpFetch` can invoke live actions.
F18/F19 and H026/H052/H126 track isolation, authorization, and audit fixes;
they have not been implemented by this documentation update.

The sample-payload picker is fed by
`/api/admin/automations/recent-events?kind=<kind>&limit=N` —
indexed on `(kind, received_at)`, returns the last N events in that
slice.


### Inference observability (M5)

Owned by `crates/server/src/inference_metrics.rs` (counters) and
`crates/server/src/inference_admin.rs` (HTTP).

`InferenceMetrics::observe(consumer, fut)` wraps async LLM calls,
recording four counters per `InferenceConsumer`:

| Counter | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `in_flight` | Current outstanding calls. |
| `total_calls` | Lifetime monotonic. |
| `total_failures` | Subset that returned `Err(_)`. |
| `last_durations_ms` | 256-deep ring buffer; snapshot computes p50 + p95. |

Panic-safe via `InflightGuard` (RAII) — a panic propagating through
the wrapped future decrements `in_flight` during unwind; total /
failure / duration counters skip on panic (a panicked call isn't
"completed").

The Automations consumer slice is wired through the agent invoker.
Chat / Routines / Research are wired incrementally — wrapping their
`chat_completions` call with `state.inference_metrics.observe(consumer, …)`.
Until they're wired, the `/admin/inference` page just shows the
consumers that ARE wired.

UI lives at **Settings → Inference**. Auto-refresh on a 5 s tick;
operator can pause via the switch.

spelunking logs.


## Operator playbook

### Create your first automation

1. **Settings → Backends** — make sure the Standard backend row is
   configured. For automations with image attachments, also configure
   a `Vision` row.
2. **Sidebar → Automations** — click **+ New automation**.
3. **Trigger** — pick a `BusEventKind` (`webhook.received` is the
   common starting point). Optionally write a Rhai `when` clause
   like `event.source == "webhook:ring"`.
4. **Nodes** — drag in `Filter`, `Transform`, `AskAgent`, or `Branch`
   nodes. Connect them with edges; add `when` clauses on edges to
   route conditionally.
5. **Test run** — open the test-run drawer, pick a recent event from
   the dropdown (or synthesize a payload), click **Run**. The trace
   table shows each node's input/output/duration inline. Until H126 is
   implemented, this can execute live effects; use disposable integrations
   and state for development, not a production workflow preview.
6. **Save** — server validates the graph + persists. Errors surface
   inline.

### Diagnose a stuck automation

- **Settings → Inference**: is the agent backend in flight forever?
  A non-zero `in_flight` count for Automations that doesn't drain
  means the LLM is hung. Restart the backend container.
- **`/automations/:id/runs`**: open the most recent run, expand the
  trace. The failing node's `error` field carries the message — Rhai
  parse error, missing config field, agent capability rejection, etc.
- **Bus dispatcher**: look for `automation runtime: ...` entries in
  the server log. The race guard logs already-claimed-skip at debug
  level.

### Mute a noisy pattern

Click **Skip** on the suggestion card. Future sweeps stop surfacing
that `(kind, source)` pair. Un-muting is currently a direct DB
operation (`DELETE FROM state_automation_muted_patterns WHERE …`); a
settings sub-page is on the M5 deferred list.

## Deferred to follow-ups

Historical estimates below are design notes, not the implementation order or
current qualification status. Use the accepted H001-H130 tracker above;
H124-H126 own the workflow versioning, control-node, and simulation work.

| Item | Effort | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cross-consumer metrics wiring | ~1 hr/consumer | Wrap chat/routines/research LLM calls with `state.inference_metrics.observe(consumer, …)`. Mechanical. |
| Muted-patterns settings sub-page | ~½ day | Frontend table over `state_automation_muted_patterns` + unmute button. |
| Per-automation rate limits | ~1 day | New column on `state_automations`; check in matcher before queueing. |
| Vision-model managed-mode preset | ~1 day | Add a `BackendPreset` entry that pre-fills the Vision row with a known VL model + image tag. |
| `CallAutomation` (sub-automations) | ~2 days | Recursive `execute_graph` with cycle detection + depth cap. |
| Agent-drafted suggestions (LLM path) | ~3 days | Sweep extension calls `AgentInvoker` on top-N patterns; writes via `set_draft_definition`. Needs prompt iteration + daily LLM-call quota. |
| Bidirectional canvas editing | ~3–4 days | Drag-to-create-edge + kind-specific config panels on ReactFlow. |
| `AwaitApproval` node | ~3–4 days | Runtime resume architecture (paused-run status, approval-decision listener). The hardest of the M5 runtime items. |
| `Parallel` / `Join` nodes | ~3 days | Concurrent in-flight tracking, deterministic merge semantics. |
| Automation versioning | ~3–4 days | `state_automations` becomes immutable + `state_automation_versions`; runs reference `version_id`. |
| Per-user authoring | ~2 days | `created_by` column + RBAC check in admin routes. |
