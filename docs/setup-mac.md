# execlaw on macOS (Apple Silicon)

This page covers first-run setup on an Apple Silicon Mac (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4). **Intel Macs are not supported** — the only macOS-specific code path that justifies a dedicated build is Metal-accelerated inference via Ollama, which requires an Apple GPU. Run execlaw on Linux or Windows if you're on an Intel Mac.

> **Cross-OS note:** the native-Ollama subprocess path now also works on Linux and Windows when `ollama` is installed on the host — the wizard surfaces it as an alternative serving choice alongside vLLM / OpenVINO. The docs below remain authoritative for Apple Silicon (where Ollama is the *only* managed inference path); see [`docs/ollama.md`](ollama.md) for the cross-platform discovery + dropdown behaviour.

## Why Apple Silicon is special

execlaw spawns its inference engine in a Docker container on every other platform. On Apple Silicon, that path is unusable:

- **Docker Desktop on macOS** runs containers inside a Linux microVM. The VM has zero Metal access — the M-series GPU is invisible to anything inside the container, so an Ollama / llama.cpp container running on a Mac would fall back to CPU and lose the entire point of an Apple-GPU host.
- **Apple's `container` CLI** (built on Virtualization.framework, WWDC 2025) has the same limitation.
- **vLLM** has no Metal kernels at all — even running the vLLM binary natively on a Mac wouldn't help, because there's no GPU code path.

So on Apple Silicon, execlaw's control plane spawns **Ollama as a native macOS subprocess** instead of a Docker container. The control plane itself is already a per-OS native binary (`aarch64-apple-darwin`), so it supervises Ollama directly via `tokio::process` — same lifecycle contract (spawn, health-probe, restart-backoff) the Docker path uses, just without bollard in the middle.

## Prerequisites

1. **Homebrew** — install from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
2. **Ollama** — `brew install ollama`. The control plane discovers the binary in this order:
   1. `$OLLAMA_BINARY` env var (operator override).
   2. `PATH` lookup.
   3. Well-known install locations — `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama` (Apple Silicon brew prefix), `/usr/local/bin/ollama` (Linux installer / Intel-Mac brew), `/usr/bin/ollama` (Linux distro packages), per-user Windows paths.

   The same probe runs on Linux + Windows; see [`docs/ollama.md`](ollama.md) for the cross-OS discovery details. If none of the above resolve, the wizard surfaces an actionable error verbatim: `ollama binary not found — install with brew install ollama, or set OLLAMA_BINARY to an absolute path` (the install-command hint is per-OS).

3. **Disk space.** Pick a model that fits in unified memory **and** has room on disk for the GGUF blob:
   - `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M` — ~4.4 GB on disk, ~5 GB RAM.
   - `qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_K_M` — ~9 GB on disk, ~10 GB RAM.
   - `qwen2.5:32b-instruct-q4_K_M` — ~20 GB on disk, ~22 GB RAM.

   The wizard's "Detected hardware" badge shows `Apple Silicon (Metal) · NN GB` where the byte count is `sysctl hw.memsize × 2/3` — that's the conservative GPU-accessible budget on Apple Silicon and matches macOS's `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` default.

## First-run flow

1. Install + start execlaw (`execlaw install` then the launchd plist starts automatically).
2. Open the SPA. The wizard detects the M-series GPU and pre-selects the **Ollama (Apple Silicon)** preset for the Standard backend.
3. Pick the model that fits your machine.
4. Submit the wizard. The supervisor launches `ollama serve`, checks `/api/tags`, and automatically pulls the selected model when it is absent. Pull progress appears in the SPA while the backend is in `DownloadingModel`.
5. Once the pull and load complete, the backend transitions to `Healthy` and the chat path goes live.

## Active model pull

The supervisor polls `/api/tags`, streams a missing model through `POST /api/pull`, and reports byte progress through the existing `DownloadingModel` → `LoadingModel` → `Healthy` lifecycle. A manual `ollama pull <model>` remains useful only when diagnosing an automatic pull failure.

## Troubleshooting

**"ollama binary not found"** — `brew install ollama`, or set `OLLAMA_BINARY=/path/to/ollama` and restart execlaw.

**"OLLAMA_BINARY points to '…' but that file does not exist"** — typo in the env var; the discovery error names the offending path so you can copy/paste into a `ls` to debug.

**Chat 404s with "model 'qwen2.5:…' not found"** — inspect the backend pull status and logs, then run `ollama pull <model>` manually if the automatic pull failed.

**Brand indicator pulsing blue** — at least one backend is in the install / warm-up phase. Click the icon to jump to `/settings/backends` and see the per-row status.

**Detected hardware shows the wrong memory** — execlaw applies a 2/3-of-RAM cap to match macOS's `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` default. If you've raised that limit (`sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=...`), the wizard will undercount. Override via the advanced disclosure if needed; runtime hardware override lives under Settings → Hardware.

## Multiple execlaw instances on one Mac

The supervisor injects `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:{host_port}` per spawn (where `host_port` is the per-purpose pool — 8101 for Standard, 8102 for Small, etc.) so two execlaw instances on one host don't fight over Ollama's default port (11434). The model cache (`~/.ollama/models`) is shared across instances by default; set the `OLLAMA_MODELS` env var in execlaw's launchd plist if you need per-instance isolation.

## Future engines

The `binary_hint` indirection in `model_spec_json` keeps the door open for additional Apple-native engines:

- **MLX** (`mlx_lm.server`) — Apple's native framework; ~10–30% faster than llama.cpp Metal for supported quants, at the cost of a Python venv + `pip install mlx-lm` first-run dance.
- **llama.cpp `llama-server`** — Ollama's underlying engine, exposed directly. More configuration knobs, less curation.

Neither ships in v1; both slot in by adding a `discover_<engine>` function + a match arm in `NativeServiceController::discover_for_hint` + a preset row. The wizard, supervisor, and brand indicator are runtime-agnostic from there.
